# Consistent Development environments using devcontainers

- This is a `python` devcontainer with `postgres` as a database.
- It installs `uv` for dependency management.
- `Docker-outside-Docker` feature is installed to make `docker` available inside the devcontainer.

## Usage

- Reopen the project in devcontainers and then run

```sh
python main.py
```
